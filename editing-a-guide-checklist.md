# Renaming or moving a guide

When moving a guide to a different directory, either an inner directory or a new directory
altogether, make sure to run through this checklist to make sure everything is in working order.
This is also applicable (somewhat) when renaming a guide.

- [ ] Did the guide have a corresponding community post? Go to the community post and update the link
      there.

- [ ] Make sure to run `npm run build` to check for broken links. Sometimes, that doesn't catch errors
      on local machines for some reason, not sure why, but the GitHub actions builder will catch it for sure.
