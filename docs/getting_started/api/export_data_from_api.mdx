title: Export Data from API
---

The API has endpoints that allows the user to retrieve all the telemetry data from devices.
There is two different endpoint available.

## Aggregated Data
This data is aggregated by interval and a method (average, min, max), and is among other
things used for the charts in our frontend dashboard.

The aggregated data can be retrieved by using this endpoint:

```
GET /logbook/storage/read/
```

Additional API documentation here:

https://api.autopi.io/#/logbook/logbook_storage_read_list

The endpoint takes the following parameters

| Parameter | Description  |
| -------------: | :---------- |
|  device_id | ID of the device **(not the unit_id)** |
|  field | The field that the value should be retrieved from. See 'Field' below |
|  field_type | The type of the field. See 'Field' below. [float, geo_point, string, long] |
|  from_utc | From time in UTC. ISO format. "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" |
|  to_utc | To time in UTC. ISO format. "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" |
|  interval | This is the interval to use when aggregating. ie. data for 24 hour queried with interval set to '1h' will return 24 data points, one for each hour. Ignored when aggregation is set to 'none' |
|  aggregation | Method used when aggregating data into the specified interval. [average, min, max, none]. |
|  size | Only used when aggregation is set to 'none', and will then return non aggregated values. |

### Examples

#### How get logged altitude aggregated into 1 minute average values

```
GET /logbook/storage/read/
    ?device_id=6a6c53b5-e18e-4301-9c95-2516006bf7c6
    &field=track.pos.alt
    &field_type=float
    &aggregation=avg
    &from_utc=2020-07-06T10:03:36.352Z
    &to_utc=2020-07-06T12:18:14.050Z
    &interval=1m
```

#### How get latest value (set aggregation = none, and to_utc can be omitted.

```
GET /logbook/storage/read/
    ?device_id=6a6c53b5-e18e-4301-9c95-2516006bf7c6
    &field=track.pos.alt
    &field_type=float
    &aggregation=none
    &from_utc=2020-07-06T10:03:36.352Z
```

### Field

To know which fields you can retrieve data from, you can get the list from the following endpoint:

https://api.autopi.io/#/logbook/logbook_storage_fields_list

This will return all the available fields that can be queried, including the type of the field.
The data type can be derived from the fields, like so:

| Field | Datatype |
| :---- | :------- |
| obd.speed.value | obd.speed |
| obd.bat.level | obd.bat |

etc.

This is the list of data types currently available from a standard device.

| Datatype       | 
| :------------- |
| acc.xyz |
| ec2x.data_usage |
| obd.ambiant_air_temp |
| obd.bat |
| obd.coolant_temp |
| obd.engine_load |
| obd.fuel_level |
| obd.intake_temp |
| obd.rpm |
| obd.speed |
| rpi.temp |
| track.pos |
â€‹
## Raw Data
The raw data is not aggregated or treated in any way, it is in the same format as it was when it was sent by the device. Remember to keep the time frame of your search narrows to be sure you'll get data back.

```
GET /logbook/storage/raw/
```

https://api.autopi.io/#/logbook/logbook_storage_raw_list

| Parameter       | Description  |
| -------------: | :---------- |
|  device_id | ID of the device **(not the unit id)** |
|  data_type | Optional. The datatype to retrieve. Will return all datatypes of omitted. See 'Field' above. |
|  start_utc | From time in UTC. ISO format. "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" |
|  end_utc | To time in UTC. ISO format. "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" |
|  use_upload_time | Optional. If false (default), *start_utc* and *end_utc* will mean 'period when the data was **recorded**'. If true, *start_utc* and *end_utc* will mean 'period when the data was **uploaded**'. |

### Example 
How get logged position objects raw

```
GET logbook/storage/raw/
    ?device_id=6a6c53b5-e18e-4301-9c95-2516006bf7c6
    &data_type=track.pos
    &start_utc=2020-11-24T10:13:21.276594Z
    &end_utc=2020-11-24T11:07:07.177850Z
```

## How to Export Trips

To get trips data you will have to first retrieve the list of trips, and then retrieve the data
that you need for the duration of the trip.

The trips endpoint here can give you the trips. (The trips can also be exported to excel/csv
format from the trips page) https://api.autopi.io/#/logbook/logbook_trips_list

The reason that there is no single endpoint way to retrieve all data for a specific trip is because
there can be a lot of data for trips, and our system can query and filter very large amounts of data
very very fast, but the downside is that it is not really geared towards downloading large amounts
of data in one go.

For enterprise customers we also support automatic exporting of trips which will call a webhook on
an external system signalling that an export can be downloaded.
