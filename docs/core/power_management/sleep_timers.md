title: Sleep Timers

Sleep timers are a functionality built into the AutoPi who's purpose is to protect the battery of your vehicle by
limiting the amount of power required by the device when it's plugged into a vehicle. On this page, we will explore how
you can work with the sleep timers using a command and look over some of the configuration options that are available
to manipulate how sleep timers are added and cleared from the device.

## The `power.sleep_timer` Command

Let us start by going through the command that you can use to view, set and unset sleep timers. The command is
[`power.sleep_timer`](core/commands/power.md#powersleep_timer). If you execute the command on its own, it will return
the currently set sleep timers on the device:

```bash
user@my_device $ power.sleep_timer 
_sleep_timer/inactivity_fallback:
  function: power.sleep
  _stamp: '2023-05-08T09:26:57.353790'
  name: _sleep_timer/inactivity_fallback
  seconds: 10800
  enabled: true
  job_args: []
  return_job: false
  jid_include: true
  maxrunning: 1
  job_kwargs:
    delay: 60
    reason: inactivity_fallback
    interval: 21600
    confirm: true
  metadata:
    transient: true
    revision: 2
    expires: '2023-05-08T12:25:13.961144'
    created: '2023-05-08T09:25:13.961144'
```

In the code snippet above, we can see that there is a sleep timer currently set for `my_device` - the `_sleep_timer/inactivity_fallback`
sleep timer. That sleep timer will expires at `2023-05-08T09:25:13.961144` - note that this timestamp is in UTC, as are
all timestamps generated by an AutoPi device. The expiration timestamp is the moment when the device will initiate its
"Going to sleep" sequence.

You can recognize that the device doesn't have any sleep timers set, if you receive an empty response from the
`power.sleep_timer` command, like seen below:

```bash
user@my_device $ power.sleep_timer 
{}
```

If you don't see any sleep timers set, that means the device won't go down to sleep. Or at least, until a new sleep
timer is set. A new sleep timer can be set in different situations, based on the configuration of the device, but it's
important to remember that there could be new sleep timers set, even if you clear all current timers. Usually, this
happens only when the device detects that a trip with a vehicle has ended, using the Event Driven sleep timer (we will
explore that a little later).

To clear all sleep timers, we can use the following command:

```bash
user@my_device $ power.sleep_timer clear=*
{}
```

To clear a specific sleep timer, we can run the command by passing the name of the sleep timer into the `clear`
argument, like so:

```bash
user@my_device $ power.sleep_timer clear=inactivity_fallback
{}
```

When running the `power.sleep_timer` with the `clear` argument set, the command will clear all sleep timers that match
the expression passed in the `clear` argument and then return all currently active sleep timers. Most of the time,
when you clear sleep timers, you will receive an empty response back, saying that there are no sleep timers left.

## Configuration Options

Now, it's time for us to look through how we can configure the automatic sleep timers of the AutoPi. We will explore
first how to automate setting of sleep timers (i.e. when the device should go to sleep and for how long). Then, we will
also look into how we can automate the clearing of sleep timers.

### Power > Sleep Timer

The [sleep timer](cloud/configuration/power.md#sleep-timer) section of the Advanced Power settings allows you to
configure how the device behaves in terms of setting and clearing sleep timers automatically. The `Event Driven`,
`Inactivity After Sleep` and `Inactivity Fallback` settings configure how the device goes to sleep, while the `Suppress`
section configures the device on how to stay awake.

#### Setting Sleep Timers

Firstly, let's take a look at the settings that set sleep timers.
The common settings amongst all of them are the following:

- **Period** - The period defines how long the device will stay awake for before going to sleep due to this sleep timer.
- **Interval** - The interval defines the amount of time the device will sleep for, due to this sleep timer.
- **Delay** - The delay is the amount of time to wait before going to sleep. The delay is applied after the period has
  expired, but before the device actually powers off.

Now, let's discuss the functionalities each one brings to the table:

- **Event Driven** - The `Even Driven` sleep timer get's set when the event defined in its `Event Regex` option is
  triggered by the device. This event can either be one of the default ones (like
  [Engine events](cloud/events/vehicle.md#engine-events) such as `vehicle/engine/stopped` or
  [Communication events](cloud/events/vehicle.md#communication-events) such as `vehicle/communication/disconnected`).
  The purpose of this sleep timer is to put the device to sleep when we have detected that the vehicle is no longer
  being used (hence the engine/stopped instead of engine/running, which we will see in the suppress settings further
  down).

- **Inactivity After Sleep** - The `Inactivity After Sleep` sleep timer get's set when the device wakes up and does not
  see the event defined in the *Suppress > Event Regex* configuration (explained in next section). This sleep timer is
  usually set when the device wakes up from its sleep due to an expired `Interval`, but the vehicle the device is
  plugged into isn't on or running.

- **Inactivity Fallback** - The `Inactivity Fallback` sleep timer get's set when the device has been freshly plugged
  into a power source, the event defined in the `Event Driven` regex isn't seen and the suppress event hasn't been
  triggered in this power cycle. In essence it works exactly the same as the `Inactivity After Sleep` sleep timer,
  however is only triggered upon first plugging in the device into power.

#### Suppressing Sleep Timers

Now, let's explore the `Suppress` section of the Advanced Power settings. This section defines how the device will
clear and suppress further sleep timers from putting the device to sleep. There's two options available in this
section - `Event Regex` and `Schedule`.

##### `Event Regex`

Let's start with the `Event Regex`. This option allows you to set a regex pattern that will be matched against every
event that get's triggered inside the device. What this allows us to do is to set a specific event, that when triggered,
will clear all sleep timers that have been setup on the device. It also prevents new sleep timers from being set until
another event is seen (specifically, the `Event Regex` from the `Event Driven` sleep timer).

Common examples here are using the opposite events from the `Event Driven` sleep timer:
[Engine events](cloud/events/vehicle.md#engine-events) like `vehicle/engine/started` or
[Communication events](cloud/events/vehicle.md#communication-events) like `vehicle/communication/established`. Note that
here, we are looking for an event that shows the vehicle is now being driven, so we want to clear the sleep timers as
we don't want the device to go to sleep, but instead record all of our data.

##### `Schedule`

Next, we have the `Schedule` option. That option allows us to setup a schedule for the device for when it should be
awake and how long it should be awake for. This option is useful for situations where you need the device to be awake
at specific times of the day and stay awake for the necessary duration. The way this setting is defined is by writing
a cron expression, then the pipe sign (`|`), followed by the amount of time the device should be awake for in seconds.
Let's go through an example:

```
0 9 9 5 * | 3600
```

If we grab just the `0 9 9 5 *` part, which is the cron expression and paste it into a crontab resolver, we will find
that this expression will be executed on 9th May at 9:00 AM in UTC time. Remember that the devices are all working in
UTC, so this (suppress) expression will also be resolved in UTC. Next, the `3600` portion says that the device will
stay awake starting at that time for 1 hour in the future.

This means that the device will be woken up at the appropriate time and then any sleep timers that are added to the
device will be adjusted to ensure the device will be awake for the desired duration. For example, suppose we have set
the suppress schedule to keep the device up for the next hour. Now, if the device automatically adds a sleep timer, or
if we add it manually using the `power.sleep_timer` command, the new sleep timer set will be adjusted so that it only
puts the device to sleep after the hour from the suppress schedule passes.

## Conclusion

To wrap it all up, it's important to remember that the AutoPi device will automatically setup sleep timers in an
attempt to protect your vehicle's battery.

You are able to adjust and clear the sleep timers so they fit your need and you can also setup the configuration for the
device so that it sleeps and is awake exactly when you need it to.
