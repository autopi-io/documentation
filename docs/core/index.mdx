This section explores the [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) Core system, which is one part of the [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) platform. The [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io)
Core is an open-source software running on the hardware device. It is built on [salt stack](https://saltproject.io/).

## What is [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) Core?
The [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) Core is a system that runs on the [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) device. It includes a vast range of
functionalities such as services that manage different components in the device. For example,
there is the [OBD service](/core/services/obd_manager.md), which controls how the device communicates
with the OBD-II port of your vehicle. There is also the [tracking service](/core/services/tracking_manager.md),
which controls the GPS modem inside the device.

There are also many modules that provide a single execution commands that help to manage or work
with the device. Modules are separated by functionality, for example, the [OBD module](/core/commands/obd.md)
provides commands that work with the OBD-II port of your vehicle, just like the OBD service
mentioned above. The [ec2x module](/core/commands/ec2x.md) has commands to manage the Quectel 4G/GPS
modem.
