Commands are executed on the device. They can be run remotely from the [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management) terminal or through the local dashboard accessible via the WiFi hotspot. Commands can even be executed directly from the Linux shell via the built-in `autopi` executable.

:::note
You can actually program your own commands in Python through the [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) Cloud. When logged in go to: _Device_ -> _Custom Code_

:::tip
Like any [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management) functionality, commands can be executed programmatically through the [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) REST API. For more information see: https://api.autopi.io/#dongle-execute-create
