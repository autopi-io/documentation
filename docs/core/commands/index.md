Commands are executed on the device. They can be run remotely from the cloud terminal or through the local dashboard accessible via the WiFi hotspot. Commands can even be executed directly from the Linux shell via the built-in `autopi` executable.

:::note
You can actually program your own commands in Python through the AutoPi Cloud. When logged in go to: _Device_ -> _Custom Code_

:::tip
Like any AutoPi cloud functionality, commands can be executed programmatically through the AutoPi REST API. For more information see: https://api.autopi.io/#dongle-execute-create
