### Highlighted features

* CAN bus logging from dual interface: Setup loggers in the AutoPi cloud to log full CAN-FD bus from the dual interface on the device. Configure bitrate, CAN bus termination, bus autodetection and much more, from a remote cloud solution.
* Configure storage endpoints: Setup different storage endpoints from our cloud solution. Configure data to be uploaded to Amazon AWS S3, store it on the local eMMC or an external flashdrive.
* Configure CAN bus decoding: Utilize the power of the edge device and do on board CAN decoding. Let the heavy lifting be done remote instead of on expensive cloud servers. Upload your proparitary DBC files to get the right data delivered remote.
* Remote live debugging: Use Tailscale to login to the CAN-FD Pro and do live remote debugging and interaction with CAN busses. Use Docker images to deploy your custom projects to the device.
* Setup advanced CAN bus filters: With CAN bus filters, you can setup the device to ensure delivery of only the most important data from your CAN bus. Add pass/block filters based on message ID's of each individual CAN frame.
* Setup mix-in of additional data and encryption: Use the edge device capabilities to mix-in other data sets in your CAN data. This could be IMU/GPS data from the on board components or connect an external sensor to mix-in. Encrypt and sign data with the onboard NXP SE51 secure element.
