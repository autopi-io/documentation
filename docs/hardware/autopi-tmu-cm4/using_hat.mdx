title: Using the HAT
---

The AutoPi TMU CM4 comes with an integrated 40 pin header (1.27mm pitch). It is possible to use the header to design HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) boards that greatly extends the functionality of the device. The image below shows the placement of the HAT on the board. It has been designed, so that a new HAT can fit into the casing.
