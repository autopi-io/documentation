### Step-by-step guide

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 1: </strong>
		Take your AutoPi and flip it so you can face the bottom of the device. Unscrew the bottom cover of the device and get out the shield that was previously installed and disconnect the internal antennas.

	<p>
		<strong>Step 2: </strong>
		Next, plug in each of the antennas in their respective socket as seen in the picture bellow: <br/>
		 <ul>
		 	<li>The GPS antenna (the one that is separated) should be connected to the left side connector of the modem</li> 
		 	<li>The middle antenna (Main 4G) should be connected to the middle connector of the modem</li>
			<li>The right antenna (Alt. 4G) should be connected to the right connector of the modem</li></ul><br/>
			<strong>Note: </strong>
			Please make sure that the antennas are not stuck in between the casings or that they are accidentally screwed in when you put back the screws in the casing. Once installed,
			don't tighten the SMA nut anymore because the cables will twist and be damaged in the interior of the device.

	<p>
		<strong>Step 4: </strong>
		Screw back in the four metal screws that you took out in the beginning. You donâ€™t have to worry about where to put them as they all have the same dimensions.
