This section explores the hardware components of the AutoPi and how they differ from one generation
to another.

## AutoPi Hardware
The AutoPi device is built with two major components - an AutoPi board and a Raspberry Pi. The 
AutoPi board has the OBD-II connector, used to plug the AutoPi device into your vehicle, but also
has many other components (chips) that work together to provide the full AutoPi experience.

The AutoPi board is then connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins and an extra USB connector to
build the full AutoPi device. There are two generations of AutoPi devices - Generation 2, which uses
a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Generation 3 (also called TMU) which uses a Raspberry Pi 3A+. It is
also possible to use Pi 3B+ or Pi 4 with the TMU device.

We also offer a DiY device, which includes only the AutoPi Board. This way you can decide which
allows you to chose which Raspberry Pi you'd like to use, while also leaving the assembly for
yourself, if you are a tech enthusiast.
