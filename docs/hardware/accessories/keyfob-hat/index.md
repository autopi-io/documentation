Many different approaches to lock/unlock exist already, but with the solution from [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io), you receive an agnostic solution working across all make and models available. These are some of the benefits:
-	No wire cutting needed, which means your vehicleâ€™s warranty is not voided 
-	Easy and fast installation and removal
-	Supports keyless ignition for vehicles with electronic start/stop technology
-	Build-in immobilizer for vehicles with electronic start/stop technology 
Several different keyless entry solutions exist on the market today. All the different types of solutions have pros and cons, but one universal solution does not exist.
