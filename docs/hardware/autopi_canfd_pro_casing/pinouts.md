The [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io/) [CAN-FD Pro device](https://shop.autopi.io/products/autopi-can-fd-pro) is packed into a durable, IP67-rated aluminum casing â€” built to withstand dust, dirt, and water, making it perfect for rugged, outdoor, or industrial installations. Inside the device it's possible to access additional GPIO pins for your project. These are conviniently located at a set of screw terminal blocks inside the device. There is 23 connections in total:

The screw terminals is applied to a custom AutoPi HAT board located inside the CAN-FD Pro device, giving you easy access to a number of selected pins:

The pinouts have the following functions assigned, note some of them are already pre assigned for the OBD-II connector on the device:

If you want to use some of the additional pins in the screw terminal, then its important that you use the correct cable transfer out of the box, to maintain the IP67 integrety. An alternative is to use some of the unused cables in the OBD connector as this is already IP67 rated. These unused cables has been neatly tied up inside the box in flex wrapping.
