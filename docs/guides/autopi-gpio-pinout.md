title: AutoPi GPIO pinout
---

This image is an overview of the GPIO pinout of the AutoPi. 

Pins marked with "in use" cannot be used for anything else. This will interrupt the functionality of the AutoPi. This I2C bus is used by the AutoPi, but can be shared with other devices. 

All other pins are free and their functionality follows that of the Raspberry Pi.
