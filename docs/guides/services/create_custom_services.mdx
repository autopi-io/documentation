Sometimes, the pre-defined services won't implement the functionality that you're looking to have
in your AutoPi. It is possible to create custom services that run on the device alongside the rest
of AutoPi's services. This guide will explore how to do that.

## Creating a Custom Service

:::note
Make sure that your device is updated, as that will otherwise prevent you from syncing the
modules.
:::

1. Go to the **Advanced** > **Custom Code** section and click **Create**.
2. Fill out the fields, and change the type to **Service**
3. After changing the type, the code editor will show the sample code for a basic service,
  like this:

  ![Default custom service code](/img/guides/create_custom_services/default_custom_service_code.png) 

  This is a basic service, which logs when it starts and stops, you can then modify this to do
  whatever you like. Just remember that the code inside the try except must be blocking, so the
  above example will continuously start and stop.

4. When you click save, the custom module will be saved, and it will also create a new service for
  you. This service is by default not enabled. To enable the service, click the icon to navigate
  to the service.

  ![Link to custom service](/img/guides/create_custom_services/link_to_custom_service.png)

  And then check the enabled checkbox in the settings tab, and click save.

  ![Enabling a custom service](/img/guides/create_custom_services/enabling_a_custom_service.png) 

5. Now sync the changes by clicking the sync button.
6. When asked if you want to restart the salt-minion process, you should click yes, as the service
  is not loaded until the process has been restarted. You can also restart the minion process by
  running the following commands:

  ```
  # In web terminal
  $ minionutil.restart

  # In SSH terminal
  $ systemctl restart salt-minion
  ```

## PIP Requirements
You can add PIP requirements to custom code modules like so:

![Adding PIP requirements](/img/guides/create_custom_services/adding_pip_requirements.png) 

:::tip
You must follow the default python requirements.txt convention to define your PIP requirements.
:::

## Pass Settings Into the Service.

To pass settings into the service, you should set the settings field to a *valid* JSON object.

![Passing settings to custom service](/img/guides/create_custom_services/passing_settings_to_custom_service.png) 

Which can then be accessed inside the service like so:

```python
some_setting = settings.get("some_setting", "default_value")
```

## A Few Examples

### Log Hello World Every 5 Seconds

Let's try creating a service that simply outputs "Hello World" to the log every 5 seconds.

```python
import logging
import time

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def start(**settings):
    try:
        log.info("Starting SERVICE with settings: {:}".format(settings))

        while True:
            log.info('HELLO WORLD, anything new in the last 5 seconds?')
            time.sleep(5)

    except Exception:
        log.exception("Failed to start SERVICE")

        raise
    finally:
        log.info("Stopping SERVICE")

        # Stop everything, close connections etc.
```

And if you have `info` level debugging configured on your device, you should now see it logging
'HELLO WORLD' every 5 seconds.

:::note
The log level of the device can be changed from the advanced settings, under **System** >
**Logging level**
:::

### Listen to MQTT Topics
This service will subscribe to all topics and log the messages. Remember to add the following PIP
requirements to the module:

```
paho-mqtt==1.5.0
```

**Code**:

```python
import logging
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

connect_results = {
    0: "Connection accepted",
    1: "The Server does not support the level of the MQTT protocol requested by the Client",
    2: "The Client identifier is correct UTF-8 but not allowed by the Server",
    3: "The Network Connection has been made but the MQTT service is unavailable",
    4: "The data in the user name or password is malformed",
    5: "The Client is not authorized to connect",
}

def on_message(mqttc, obj, msg):
    log.info(msg.topic + " " + str(msg.qos) + " " + str(msg.payload))

def on_subscribe(mqttc, obj, mid, granted_qos):
    log.info("Subscribed: " + str(mid) + " " + str(granted_qos))

def on_log(mqttc, obj, level, string):
    log.info(string)

def on_connect(mqttc, obj, flags, rc):
    result = "{:}: {:}".format(rc, connect_results.get(rc, "Unknown result code"))    
    if rc == 0:
        log.info(result)
    else:
        raise Exception(result)

    try:
        mqttc.subscribe("#", qos) # Subscribes to all topics.
    except Exception as ex:
        log.exception("Exception occurred when setting up registers")

# glocal settings
qos = 0

def start(**settings):
    global qos

    usetls = True
    tlsVersion = None # will use most recent version
    cacerts = None

    port = 8883
    host = ""
    username = "username"
    password = "password"

    debug = False
    keepalive = 60

    # Setup
    mqttc = mqtt.Client(None, clean_session=True)
    if usetls:
        mqttc.tls_set(ca_certs=cacerts, certfile=None, keyfile=None, cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED, tls_version=tlsVersion)
    mqttc.username_pw_set(username, password)

    mqttc.on_message = on_message
    mqttc.on_connect = on_connect
    mqttc.on_subscribe = on_subscribe

    if debug:
        mqttc.on_log = on_log

    try:
        log.info("Starting MQTT engine")

        log.info("Connecting to {:} port: {:}".format(host, port))
        mqttc.connect(host, port, keepalive)
        mqttc.loop_forever(retry_first_connection=True)

    except Exception:
        log.exception("Failed to start MQTT engine")

        raise
    finally:
        log.info("Stopping MQTT engine")
        mqttc.disconnect()
```
