import SideBySide from '@site/src/components/SideBySide';

:::caution Before proceeding with the upgrade
Please read the **whole guide** in order to have a good understanding of how all the components fit together.

You need to be careful not to tear or damange some of the cables when handling the casing of the device.

### Disassembling the AutoPi Device

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 1: </strong>On the bottom side of the device,
		remove the screws that hold the casing in
		place.
	</p>

</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 2: </strong>Open the bottom casing on the
		side, just like a book. Be careful when
		doing this as there is a cable connection
		between the modem and the casing.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 2" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v2.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 3: </strong>Remove all three cable
		connections from the modem module. The
		cables need to be pulled up to be removed
		from their sockets. There are two black
		cables on each side and one gray cable in
		the middle. We suggest using a pair of
		pliers to help you with this.
	</p>

</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 4: </strong>
		Remove both shields from the
		back and the side. They just need to be
		slid up.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 4" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v4.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Note: </strong>
		At the front of the device, there is a plastic
		OBD connector. In the next step, you will
		need to grab the OBD connector and pull
		it up from the top casing.
	</p>
	<img alt="Note" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v4-1.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 5: </strong>
		Slowly pull up the board by the
		OBD connector. Beneath, you will find a
		speaker and a yellow battery attached to
		the top casing. You will need to remove
		the cables of those two components from
		the board. To remove the cables, simply
		pull them out of their sockets.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 5" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v5.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Note: </strong>
		Once detached from the battery and the
		speaker, your AutoPi device will look like
		this, with the modem facing upwards.
	</p>
	<img alt="Note" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v5-1.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 6: </strong>
		Turn the board around to reveal
		the Raspberry Pi. You can also see the
		memory card from this side. Next, remove
		the plastic screws that secure the
		Raspberry. Disconnect the USB
		cable.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 6" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v6.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 7: </strong>
		Gently pull out the Raspberry Pi
		from the board. All the GPIO pins from
		the Raspberry Pi get connected to the
		sockets on the board. You should be able
		to get them out of their sockets by either
		pulling firmly, or wiggling left to right.
	</p>

</SideBySide>

### Assembling Back the AutoPi Device

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 8: </strong>
		Grab your new Raspberry Pi board.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 8" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v8.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 9: </strong>
		Plug in your new Raspberry Pi
		into the board. The memory card slot
		should be facing the OBD connector. To
		plug in, simply align the GPIO pins with
		their respective sockets and push down.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 9" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v9.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 10: </strong>
		Plug in the USB cable. Don’t
		forget to plug in your memory card as
		well.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 10" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v10.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 11: </strong>
		Turn the device around and
		prepare the casing. You will need to
		connect the battery and the speaker cables
		first.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 11" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v11.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 12: </strong>
		Connect both cables to the board.
		The battery has a smaller connector, while
		the speaker has a bigger connector.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 12" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v12.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Note: </strong>
		The cables need to be connected like this.
		For both, the red cable always goes on the
		outside, the black cable goes on the inside.
	</p>
	<img alt="Note" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v12-1.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 13: </strong>
		Tuck both cables beneath the
		device and place it back into the casing
		like this. The OBD connector has a thin
		cutout along the plastic of where the
		casing needs to fit in. However, make sure
		that the black and gray cables are sticking
		out from the side, as you will need to
		connect them to the modem in the next step.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 13" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v13.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 14: </strong>
		Connect the antennas by placing
		them on their sockets and the firmly
		pushing down until you hear a *<strong>click</strong>*
		sound. The black cable goes on the side
		while the gray one goes in the middle. In
		addition, you will also need to slide down
		the back shield and the lateral shield.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 14" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v14.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 15: </strong>
		Prepare the bottom casing and
		place it in the same position as when you
		took it out. You will then need to connect
		the black cable to the last remaining
		socket on the modem. Fold down the
		casing so the device completely seals.
	</p>
	<img alt="Step 15" src={require('@site/static/img/guides/upgrading_your_raspberry_pi/v15.jpg').default}/>
</SideBySide>
<br/>

<SideBySide>
	<p>
		<strong>Step 16: </strong>
		Finally, screw back in the four
		metal screws that you took out in the
		beginning. You don’t have to worry about
		where to put them as they all have the
		same dimensions.
	</p>
