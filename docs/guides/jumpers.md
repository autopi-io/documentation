Jumpers are a very small devices which are used to jump the electrical current from one pin to another. In this guide,
we will talk about jumpers. More specifically, we'll talk about what they are used for and how you can use one for
your device.

## How jumpers help

With a jumper you can force the AutoPi to maintain the 5V supply on all the time. This effectively means that the
Raspberry Pi wont be able to go to sleep or hibernation, because you disable the Smart Power Manager (SPM) chip.

The jumper will come in handy when you debug or develop new core features, where you want to change the functionality
of the SPM. For normal use it shouldnâ€™t be necessary.

## Using a jumper

To use a jumper, you will need to open up your AutoPi device. On the inside of the device, you'll see two boards
connected to each other. One of them being the Raspberry Pi and the other - the AutoPi board. On the AutoPi board, you
should be able to see two pins on one of the four corners, next to which is written 'FORCE 5V'.

Here are pictures of the locations for second generation devices:
