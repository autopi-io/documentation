DBC files describe the CAN network traffic of a vehicle. It specifies what modules are within it,
what messages they can send, the messages' signals and details about them. In this guide we're
going to review how you can import these files in [my.autopi.io](https://my.autopi.io), how to
improve their readability and how you can share them with the rest of the community.

## Steps to Import a New DBC File in Your Library

1. Go to **Car Explorer** > **Library** and click on the Import button:

2. Select DBC from the dropdown menu that shows up and select the file from your filesystem.
3. A list of the imported CAN signals will show up in your library.

## Adding Descriptions for Better Readability

Some signal names can be very self explanatory. However some messages might be harder to
understand. You can add descriptions to those messages to make it easier to recognize them in the
future or for other fellow users, if you decide to share those signals with the community.

To add a description for a signal, click on the signal you want to describe. A CAN message editing
window will pop out. In this window you'll be able to see the CAN message at the top with all
signals associated with it in a list below. The signal that you clicked on will be already expanded
and highlighted in yellow.

Edit the description field of the signal and click Save. You can also associate that CAN message
with a vehicle CAN bus. You should see the CAN signal update with the new description:

## Sharing CAN Messages With the Rest of the Community
To make it easy for other community members, you can share CAN messages you've identified for your
vehicle. To do that, you must first associate a CAN message with a vehicle CAN bus, which you can
do at the bottom of the "Editing CAN Message" pop-out window. After you've saved the changes,
you'll be able to click on the "Share with the community" checkbox.

Saving the changes shares the CAN message and all signals with the community.
