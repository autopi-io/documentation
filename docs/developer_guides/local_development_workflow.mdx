When doing development with the [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io), it is possible to do it all through the [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management).

1. Make changes
2. Push changes to device
3. Restart services
4. Execute module
5. Go to step 1

But while this process can be used, it is much too slow for actual development. So the [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management) should
be used for management and to push out code when the development has finished, and not in the
actual development workflow.

Fortunately, there are other much faster alternatives, here are a few ways to do it.

## Development on RPI With Screen and Keyboard or SSH
You could instead SSH into the device and edit the files directly. When syncing from the [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management),
the modules will be put in the following directories, based on the type:

* /opt/autopi/salt/modules
* /opt/autopi/salt/returners
* /opt/autopi/salt/utils
* /opt/autopi/salt/engines
* /opt/autopi/salt/states

So you can simply edit/create the files directly, but make sure to avoid clashes with the [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management)
synced modules, to prevent losing work if you sync the module from the [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management), as that will, without
asking, overwrite the file on the device, even if you have made local changes to it.

When you make changes to the files, to make sure that the minion process picks up on the change,
this is done by restarting the service, this can be done with `minionutil.restart`. Some changes can be reloaded with `saltutil.refresh_modules`, but it's generally more safe to restart the minion service instead. To ensure all code is reloaded.

## Remote Development on Dev Machine
Alternatively, another workflow can be to have a script on your development machine that copies
the files to the device via [`scp`](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/scp.htm), that way you can
make the changes in your favorite editor. Remember to have the script also either restart the
minion service with `minionutil.restart` or run the `saltutil.refresh_modules` command as noted above. Doing development on the local
machine is preferable for many, and is also the way we do development in office as it has the
benefit of the above solution, but also allows the user to be as productive as possible by in their
preferred development environment.

We hope this helps you get started developing with our device and platform.
