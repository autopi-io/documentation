Within the Users subsection, you can search for existing users associated with your account,
as well as create new user profiles.
By clicking on the Create, you will be directed to the User Details page where you can input all
necessary information for a new user. In the Groups section, you have the capability to assign
specific permissions to user accounts. These permissions determine the level of access
granted to each account.

We offer three distinct permissions options:
- **Account Administration**: For users who need administrative control.
- **Fleet Management**: For users who require access to fleet-related data.
- **Device Management**: For users who manage device-related data.

These permissions help manage data access for your team efficiency.
