Triggers allows you to get notifications and/or perform actions both based on events from the device, but also all the various data points uploaded to the AutoPi Cloud.

_Webhooks_ are supported so you can integrate with almost any service or system. Popular examples are:

  - [Slack](https://slack.com)
  - [IFTFT](https://ifttt.com)
