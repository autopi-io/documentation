Under configuration you can find Notification Channels. Here you can create a 
notification channel, that you can later apply in different parts of the 
platform, most commonly in Geofences. 

When your account has been created, some default Notification Channels have been 
set for you like:  
- Low Alert 
- Medium Alert 
- High Alert 
- Critical Alert 

However you can edit these or create new ones. To create a notification channel,
click Create. Choose a name for the notification channel and the type of channel
that you want to receive the notification on e.g., email, webhook or SMS. You can
add multiple. Optionally, add a description to provide more information about the
channel, then click Confirm to save the changes.
