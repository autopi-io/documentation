### Trips
Next to Dashboard you’ll find the **Trips** section. This section provides detailed
information about the vehicle’s trips, displaying the trip route on a map along 
with the starting and ending addresses, duration, and distance traveled. You can 
also categorize trips as personal or business and, if necessary, export trip data.

Above the map, you have filtering options for the trips, choose a week, last month
or a custom range you would like to view, and it will show you a list of all the 
trips that have been taken by this vehicle during the filtered time. Clicking on 
one of the trips will show you a route on the map, the distance it travelled and 
how long the trip took.  

You can further filter the trip view based on the date or number of months, as 
well as by distance or duration of the trips. Next to the filtering options, you 
will see overall data of this vehicle’s trips, including the total number of 
trips made, total distance driven, total duration, and average distance and duration.

### Diagnostics
The Diagnostics tab is the last section under the Vehicle view. It displays all diagnostic error codes currently reported by the vehicle.

For each diagnostic code, you can see:
* The error code itself with description.
* The first and last occurrence timestamps.
* Count of how many times the error has occurred.

This allows you to understand not only what the issue is, but also when it started and how frequently it appears. When combined with the **Fault Codes** functionality, the Diagnostics page becomes a powerful tool for real-time monitoring. You can be alerted about critical issues immediately either through cloud notifications or email alerts, so you can react quickly to vehicle problems. Additionaly you can create a custom **Trigger** to perform an action based on any specified code.
