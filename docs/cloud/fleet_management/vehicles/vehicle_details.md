Next to Overview you’ll find the **Trips** section. This section provides detailed
information about the vehicle’s trips, displaying the trip route on a map along 
with the starting and ending addresses, duration, and distance traveled. You can 
also categorize trips as personal or business and, if necessary, export trip data.

Above the map, you have filtering options for the trips, choose a week, last month
or a custom range you would like to view, and it will show you a list of all the 
trips that have been taken by this vehicle during the filtered time. Clicking on 
one of the trips will show you a route on the map, the distance it travelled and 
how long the trip took.  

You can further filter the trip view based on the date or number of months, as 
well as by distance or duration of the trips. Next to the filtering options, you 
will see overall data of this vehicle’s trips, including the total number of 
trips made, total distance driven, total duration, and average distance and duration.
