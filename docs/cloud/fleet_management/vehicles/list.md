In the Vehicle section you can see all your vehicles, paired with a map showing 
their latest known position and geofences.

In this section, we'll focus on the **List** tab. The vehicle list displays all 
your vehicles, along with their designated names and connection. 
The columns display all the necessary information about your vehicle like for 
example the location and geofence that have been assigned to it.  

Between the world map and the list, you'll find filtering options, which are 
useful when managing many vehicles. You can search for vehicles by entering any 
identifying information. There are also **Filters** options for things like Open
Alerts, Last Communication or others. These filters help provide a clearer 
overview of your fleet.
