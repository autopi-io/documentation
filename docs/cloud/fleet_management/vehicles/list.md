## Vehicle Filters
Between the world map and the list, you'll find filtering options, which are 
useful when managing many vehicles. You can search for vehicles by entering any 
identifying information. There are also filters options for things like Open
Alerts, Last Communication or others. These filters help provide a clearer 
overview of your fleet.
