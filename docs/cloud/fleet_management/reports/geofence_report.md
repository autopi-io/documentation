import CardGrid from "/components/CardGrid" ;

The **Geofence Report** provides detailed insights into vehicle activity within 
predefined geographic areas. This report helps fleet managers:
- Track entries and exits from geofenced zones.
- Monitor unauthorized or unexpected stops.
- Evaluate route adherence and optimize routing efficiency.

## List Tab

- Access a list of all generated Geofence Reports. The list includes:
    - The creation date of each report.
    - The report name (editable during creation).
    - The report type (e.g., Geofence Report).
    - Date range (from/to).
    - The creator's name.
    - Actions: Download as PDF or delete the report.
- Click on a report to open its preview.

## Create/Schedule Tab

### Creating a Geofence Summary Report

1. From the [AutoPi](https://www.autopi.io) [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management) platform, navigate to the **Reports** menu and click 
   **Create/Schedule**.
2. Select **Geofence Summary** from the available options.
3. Fill out the template:
    - **Report Name:** Automatically generated based on the current date, but 
       you can customize it.
    - **Vehicles/Groups:** Select vehicles or vehicle groups to include in the 
      report. Use the dropdown menu to pick from available options and select 
      as many as needed.
    - **Geofences/Locations:** Choose geofences or locations to include in the 
      report. Use the dropdown menu to pick from available options and select
      as many as needed.
    - **Date Range:** Specify the start and end dates for the report.
    - **Reset:** Clears all configurations you’ve made.
    - **Preview:** Allows you to see how the report will look before saving.
    - **Save:** Saves the report and displays it under the Reports - List section.

### Scheduling a Geofence Summary Report

1. After generating a Geofence Summary Report, you can schedule it to run at 
   regular intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly):
    - Scheduled reports are automatically generated and displayed under 
      **Reports - Schedules**.
2. To schedule a report:
    - Navigate to the **Reports** menu and click **Create/Schedule**.
    - If you haven’t already created a report, follow the steps above to create one.
    - Click **Schedule** next to **Create** to open the scheduling window.
    - Fill out the schedule template:
        - **Schedule Name:** Automatically generated based on the frequency, but you can customize it.
        - **Vehicles/Groups:** Select vehicles or vehicle groups for the scheduled report.
        - **Geofences/Locations:** Choose geofences or locations to include in the report.
        - **Report Frequency:** Select Daily, Weekly, or Monthly (one option at a time).
        - **Time of Report Generation:** Set the time you want the report to be generated.
        - **Reset:** Clears all configurations you’ve made.
        - **Preview:** Allows you to see how the scheduled report will look.

## How fields in the geofence report are calculated

The fields in the **Geofence Report** are generated using data collected from GPS
locations, accelerometer readings, and other device events. Below is a breakdown 
of how each field is calculated:

1. **Total vehicles:** Displays the total number of vehicles selected when 
   creating the report.
2. **Total geofences:** Shows the total number of geofences selected during 
   report creation.
3. **Geofences interacted with:** Shows how many of the selected geofences any of the selected vehicles has interacted with, this is a subset of Total Geofences.
4. **Most time spent in:** Identifies the geofence where a vehicle spent the 
   most time. This is calculated by measuring the duration between vehicle
    **enter** and **exit** events for each geofence.
    - Detailed information, such as total time spent, number of entries, and 
      exits, is available in the report fields below.
5. **Total time in geofences:** The cumulative time for each selected vehicles 
   spent inside any selected geofence.
6. **Time inside:** For each geofence, this field shows the total time a vehicle 
   spent within that geofence. It is calculated as the sum of all durations 
   between **entry** and **exit** events.
7. **Enter/Exit:** This field counts how many times a vehicle entered and exited 
   a specific geofence. It is determined based on:
    - **Entry** events: Recorded as `vehicle/geofence/*/enter`.
    - **Exit** events: Recorded as `vehicle/geofence/*/exit`.
    - You can view these events under **Device -> Events** and apply the 
      relevant filters.
8. **Started:** Counts how many times a vehicle started within a specific geofence. 
   This is based on accelerometer data detecting motion events:
    - Filter: `vehicle/motion/shaking`.
9. **Stopped:** Counts how many times a vehicle stopped within a specific geofence.
   This is also based on accelerometer data:
    - Filter: `vehicle/motion/steady`.
10. **Idling time:** Displays the total time a vehicle spent idling within a 
    geofence. It is calculated as follows:
    - **Idling:** The engine RPM is between 0 and a predefined idle RPM threshold
      (configurable per vehicle).
    - Data source: `obd.rpm.value`.
11. **Driving time:** Indicates active driving time within the geofence. This is 
    determined when the engine RPM is higher than the idle threshold.
12. **Parked:** Shows the total time a vehicle was parked in a geofence. It is 
    calculated as:
    - **Parked time** = total time spent in the geofence - (driving time + idling time).
13. **Distance:** Displays the total distance driven within a specific geofence. 
    This is calculated using GPS points logged while the vehicle was inside the geofence.
