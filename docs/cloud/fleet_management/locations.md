The **Locations** feature enables you to create and manage various operational 
areas related to your company, such as your US office, EU office, headquarters, 
or any other key locations. This feature helps streamline your fleet management 
by allowing you to assign vehicles to specific locations, ensuring more efficient
organization and oversight.

Additionally, you can assign users to specific locations, allowing you to control
their access based on their assigned area. This means users will only see and 
manage the vehicles and operations tied to the locations they are permitted to access.  

To begin, navigate to the **Locations** tab. Here, you'll find a world map displaying 
your existing locations, along with a list view for easier navigation and management. 

### Creating a Location

![Create Location](/img/cloud/fleet_management/locations/locations_create.png)

To create a new location: 
1. Click **Create** and enter the necessary details. Required fields include the 
   location name, which will serve as an internal identifier, and a contact email. 
   You may also include additional information such as a phone number, address, 
   or notes to further describe the location. 

#### Creating a Geofence

To set up a geofence: 

2. Enter an address to zoom in on the map. 
3. Use the tools on the left side to create and edit the geofence. You can draw 
   a circle or polygon by clicking on the map to outline your desired area. 
   Additional tools allow you to edit, drag, remove, or rotate layers. 
4. Once you're satisfied with the outline, click **Submit**. You can also choose 
   a color for the geofence if desired. 

#### Managing Locations

After creating a location, it will appear in the list along with the details you 
provided. To make changes, click **Actions** and select the three dots to either 
edit or delete the location. If you have multiple locations, use the 
**Search for Location** filter to quickly find specific ones. 

#### Assigning Vehicles to a Location

To assign vehicles to a location:

5. Click on a location from the list to open the **Edit vehicles in location** pop-up. 
6. Search for and add vehicles that belong to this location or select a vehicle 
   group. If assigning vehicles individually, you can search by vehicle name, model,
   year, or other identifiers. 
7. Check the right corner to see if any vehicles are already enabled or disabled 
   for this location. Enable the vehicles you want to assign to this location. 
   You can enable multiple vehicles at once. 
8. If you’ve created a Vehicle Group (learn more [here](cloud/fleet_management/vehicles/groups.md)),
   you can quickly assign multiple vehicles by selecting ‘Groups’ and enabling 
   those that belong to the location. 
9. Click **Save & Exit** to complete the process. A notification will confirm 
   that the changes have been successfully saved. 

#### Viewing Associated Vehicles 

Back on the Locations list, the **Vehicles** column will be updated to show the 
number of vehicles associated with each location. Clicking on this number will 
take you to the Vehicle section, where you can view the specific vehicles 
assigned to that location. You can always edit the location details by selecting 
the **Actions** column.
