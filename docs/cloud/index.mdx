### Device Management
This is an area that shows the current state of your devices and allows you to easily change that
state to whatever is needed. For example, there is a section of advanced settings that are
available that change various functionalities of the device like WiFi, hotspot, accelerometer
and power settings. It is also possible to setup the device to send data back to your own servers.
This way data can be kept private if needed. It possible to manage and maintain multiple devices at the same type, by applying templates to groups of devices.


### Fleet Management

shows past OBD-II data like RPM, speed and fuel level. The device also sends back information about
[trips](/cloud/fleet_management/vehicles/trips/introduction), which are also viewable. The [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management) also keeps track of the
[events](/cloud/device_management/events/index.md) that were triggered on your device. In the events page, you are
able to view all events and filter them by date or tag.
