title: Create Custom Triggers
---

In this guide we will explore how you can create a custom trigger for your AutoPi service. The
example that we will look at is a trigger that will play a beeping sound when the vehicle's speed
is 50km/h or more. Let's dive straight in.

:::note
Service triggers are not to be confused with Cloud triggers. Although they have the same name
they have two very different functions. Service triggers work **on the device** and can respond to
data coming in from a handler in various ways (emiting events, playing audio, etc). Cloud trigers
on the other hand respond to events emited by the device **on the server side**.
:::

1. Let's start by creating a custom code module with the name *my_triggers* of type *Execution*. We
  can do that by going over to **Device** > **Custom Code**:

  ![Editing custom code](/img/cloud/device_management/services/create_custom_triggers/editing_custom_code.png) 

  Here is the code in plain text for easy copy and paste:

  ```python
  import logging
  
  from messaging import extract_error_from
  
  log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  
  def speed_warning_beep(result):
      """
      Trigger that will play a warning beep sound when vehicle speed exceeds value of 50.
      """
  
      # Check for error result
      error = extract_error_from(result)
      if error:
          log.warning("Speed warning beep trigger got error result: {:}".format(result))
  
          return
  
      # Check if speed value is above threshold
      if result.get("value", 0) >= 50:
  
          # Only play sound when threshold value is exceeded
          if not __context__.get("speed_warning_beep", False):
              __salt__["cmd.run"]("aplay /opt/autopi/audio/sound/beep.wav")
  
              # Set flag in context
              __context__["speed_warning_beep"] = True
  
      # Speed value is below threshold
      else:
  
          # Reset flag in context
          __context__["speed_warning_beep"] = False
  ```

  To quickly run through the code, this code creates a function that will check if the result
  passed to it has a `value` key that is equal to or more than 50. Once that condition is met, it
  will make sure that the vehicle isn't already in that state through the context (if the vehicle
  is continuously above 50km/h we won't play the beeping sound continuously) and if it isn't it'll
  play the beeping sound. Once the above or equal to condition is no longer met, we reset the
  context.

  Now, let's synchronise the changes to the device by clicking the **Sync** button. If the device
  is offline the changes will automatically be synchronised on next start-up.

2. Next, we need to register that trigger in the service that it'll be used. For this guide, we
  need to register it in the OBD service named **obd_manager**. Go to **Device** > **Services** >
  **obd_manager** > **Hooks** > **Create**:

  ![Creating a custom hook](/img/cloud/device_management/services/create_custom_triggers/creating_a_custom_hook.png) 

4. We now need to use the newly registered trigger hook by adding it to a workflow in a worker.
  Go to **Device** > **Services** > **obd_manager** > **Workers** > **Create**:

  ![Creating a new worker](/img/cloud/device_management/services/create_custom_triggers/creating_a_new_worker.png) 

  When the above changes have been successfully synchronised to your device, it will start checking
  the speed of your vehicle and play a single beep sound when exceeding 50km/h.

  :::note
  The `query` handler with a `SPEED` argument is only valid for some vehicles, mostly internal
  combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. If you have an electric vehicle, you might need to use a more
  sophisticated setup to get the current speed of your vehicle. We suggest that you browse forums
  for your make and model for such information.

  :::tip Not Working?
  Check the log file on the device to see if there are warnings and/or errors. Check
  [this](/developer_guides/autopi_logs.md) guide out for more information on how to retrieve the logs from your
  device.

## Want an Event Instead of a Beep?

You can freely fire events from your custom code modules. If you're looking to execute
one or multiple different actions based on some event (in this case, speeding over 50km/h), you
are able to do that. Let's add another function to the *my_triggers* custom code:

```python
def speed_warning_event(result):
    """
    Trigger that will fire a 'vehicle/speeding' event when vehicle speed exceeds value of 50.
    """

    # Check for error result
    error = extract_error_from(result)
    if error:
        log.warning("Speed warning event trigger got error result: {:}".format(result))

        return

    # Check if speed value is above threshold
    if result.get("value", 0) >= 50:

        # Only play sound when threshold value is exceeded
        if not __context__.get("speed_warning_event", False):
            __salt__["event.fire"]({}, "vehicle/speeding")

            # Set flag in context
            __context__["speed_warning_event"] = True

    # Speed value is below threshold
    else:

        # Reset flag in context
        __context__["speed_warning_event"] = False
```

The code here is esentially the same as the one presented above. The only difference is that
the AutoPi will fire an event internally instead of playing a beeping sound. This event can then
be used in the **event_reactor** service to perform other actions. Also, the event will be uploaded
to the cloud and be visible from **Device** > **Events**.
