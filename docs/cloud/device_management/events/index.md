In the Events section, you will find records of specific state changes or
conditions encountered by the device. The system running on the device is capable of
monitoring and responding to these events, performing additional actions when they
occur. Each Event includes a timestamp, a tag, and additional data fields.

Events play a crucial role in setting up triggers and are also available for
historical reference. Events are categorized into two areas: 'System' and 'Vehicle'.
In the Device Management section of the platform, you can access both System and
Vehicle events. However, in the Fleet Management section, you will find only Vehicle
Events.

For detailed information about Events and their settings, please take a look at the documentation below:

  - [System](system.md)
  - [Vehicle](vehicle.md)
