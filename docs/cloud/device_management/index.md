On this page, you will find an overview of all your devices, including their activity, alerts,
and software updates. We are committed to continual improvement, and we regularly
enhance our devices through software updates. We strongly recommend that our
customers keep their devices up to date.

Within the overview, you can see how many of your devices are currently updated,
how many have failed to update, and how many are waiting for updates.

Selecting a device allows you to view all of thhe details and manage them individually.
