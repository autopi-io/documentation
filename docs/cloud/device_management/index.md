This section of our Cloud Platform is dedicated to managing and configuring devices.
Here, you can monitor and ensure that all devices within your fleet operate optimally,
maintaining constant communication and data exchange.

On this page, you will find an overview of all your devices, including their activity, alerts,
and software updates. We are committed to continual improvement, and we regularly
enhance our devices through software updates. We strongly recommend that our
customers keep their devices up to date.

Within the overview, you can see how many of your devices are currently updated,
how many have failed to update, and how many are waiting for updates.
