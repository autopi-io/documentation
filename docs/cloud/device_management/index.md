This section of our [Cloud](https://www.autopi.io/software-platform/cloud-management) Platform is dedicated to managing and configuring devices.
Here, you can monitor and ensure that all devices within your fleet operate optimally,
maintaining constant communication and data exchange.

On this page, you will find an overview of all your devices, including their activity, alerts,
and software updates. We are committed to continual improvement, and we regularly
enhance our devices through software updates. We strongly recommend that our
customers keep their devices up to date.

Within the overview, you can see how many of your devices are currently updated,
how many have failed to update, and how many are waiting for updates.

## Device List
In this view, you have access to a list of all your devices, including their names, statuses, unit IDs, types, last communication timestamps, and update statuses. 
You can customize this view using the 'Edit Columns' feature, allowing you to include other essential identifying factors like alerts or VIN numbers.
For a faster search of your desired device, use the 'Search for Vehicle' feature at the top of the page to filter your view based on specific criteria. 
For more detailed information about a particular device, simply click on the chosen device.
