This section is all about the Cloud system. It goes over details such as the different configuraiton
options that can be set, the events that can be seen from the device. More complex functionalities
are also explored in this section.

## What is the AutoPi Cloud?

The AutoPi Cloud is a system created to more easily manage your AutoPi device. It is essentially a
friendly interface that shows the current state of the device and allows you to easily change that
state to whatever is needed. For example, there is a big section of advanced settings that are
available that change various functionalities of the device like WiFi, hotspot, accelerometer
and power settings. It is also possible to setup the device to send data back to your own servers.
This way data can be kept private if needed.

The Cloud also allows you to view data that your device has sent back. There is a dashboard that
shows past OBD-II data like RPM, speed and fuel level. The device also sends back information about
[trips](/cloud/trips.md), which are also viewable. The Cloud also keeps track of the
[events](/cloud/events/_index.md) that were triggered on your device. In the events page, you are
able to view all events and filter them by date or tag.
