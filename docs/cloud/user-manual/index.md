title: Introduction

This section of the documentation page tries to explain how to use the Cloud platform to accomplish
different tasks. The sections and subsections are structured based on the Cloud menu layout. This
means that the left-hand-side menu on [my.autopi.io](https://my.autopi.io) will correspond with the
layout of the User Manual and vice versa.

New entries will be added as documentation is expanded.

If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to us on our support channel on
support@autopi.io. We try to respond within 24 hours of receiving your email.
