On the Alerts page, you can easily check for any vehicle alerts within your fleet. To
streamline your search, use the filters at the top of the page. You can filter alerts by
their status (Open, Closed, or Resolved) and by severity (Critical, High, Medium, or Low).

You can click on an alert to access detailed information, including how many vehicles
are currently affected by this issue. Furthermore, you can view a list of specific vehicles
experiencing the alert.

Additionally, you have the option to export this data. This exported data can be
valuable for internal processes or for conducting maintenance checks with a mechanic.
